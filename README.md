# Security+_Tips

This repository will provide as a learning center those interested in Security+. I will provide information on my experience, tools, resources, and ways I studied to pass the Security+ in the hopes that this will be beneficial to others on their journey. **Note:** I will not provide answers presented on the actual exam, brain dumps, or do I condone or will provide resources that do use these methods. 

<b>Study Resources</b>

  - [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) has several learning paths that provide foundational knowledge such as the <b>Pre Security</b> and <b>Cybersecurity 101</b> learning paths, which align with many of the [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/security/) exam objectives and cover topics including Linux, networking, cybersecurity basics, core security principles, common attack vectors, and defensive strategies.
    
  - [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com) like TryHackMe, provides a gamified platform for learning cybersecurity. However, it differs in both intensity and approach. HTB is generally more challenging and less guided. Users are expected to conduct more independent research, and solutions or hints are not typically provided within the platform.

  - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) offers a wide range of resources for Security+ preparation. While there are countless channels available, [Professor Messer](https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser) stands out for his in-depth coverage of Security+ topics. His videos provide clear explanations aligned with the official exam objectives and are widely used by learners preparing for the certification.

  - The [Exam Cram](https://www.pearsonitcertification.com/store/comptia-security-plus-sy0-701-exam-cram-9780138225575) book is a great way to prepare in the final weeks before the exam. It provides practice quizzes for exam domains and full practice tests.

  - College courses, while often expensive and time-consuming, can offer excellent opportunities for cybersecurity education, including hands-on learning and skills development. [Western Governer's University](https://www.wgu.edu/) offers both Bachelor's and Master's programs in Cybersecurity. Their curriculum includes training aligned with industry certifications, including CompTIA Security+.

<b>Study Tips</b>

  - <b>Avoid burnout.</b> Take regular breaks to give your brain time to absorb the material.
  - <b>Treat studying like a job.</b> This helps build focus, discipline, and structure which will be great habits for your future career.
  - <b>View failure as feedback.</b>  Don't be too hard on yourself if you aren't where you want to be, you will get there with time.
  - <b>Study with [Active Recall](https://youtu.be/MrMAKPGjXZo?si=nrmd3m3C1k5zp6kg) techniques.</b>  Read out loud, write down notes, and quiz yourself especially in areas you find challenging.
  - <b>Study with others when possible.</b> Collaborating allows you to teach what you know and learn from others. [Studies](https://www.bps.org.uk/research-digest/learning-teaching-others-extremely-effective) show that teaching others improves retention.
